Totally awesome feature, that no other game I've played today has:

* It can draw an image
* That image can move using the keyboard
* The image can't escape - no matter how hard you press the arrow keys!
* The red image hates the blue image, so it can't overlap it!
* It can play sounds
* High tech text rendering
* It can draw something from a tileset!
* Basic map rendering. With animated tiles!

Yes - I am a programming genius.
